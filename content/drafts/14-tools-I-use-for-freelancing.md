## 1. Banking

**Coconut**



*Sidenote: I'm thinking of switching back to Starling Bank/Tide as they both offer a web portal, this becomes super handy when I need to add receipts and most of my purchases as a business are made through online companies. Coconut is designed to be a replacement for expense/invoice tracking but it doesn't quite work yet.*

## 2. Accounting

**Wave Accounting**

I haven't really found anything that offers more without charging Â£20 p/m, since Wave is free, it's been another layer ontop of Coconut for me to track and manage my expenses.

**Google Sheets**

I keep a tally of running costs, estimated tax payments etc into a Google Sheet also
